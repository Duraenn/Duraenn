**I am TR77, Also known as TryMaker77**

----

I  have a general passion for computers, electronics, and computer sciences with I explore through my personal work. These intrests have lead me to create groups such as the S3CO record label and the Durian Technologies collective. I like to view myself as an all purpouse creative, and some of the stuff I work on includes:
- My Programming (You can find that here)
- My Music ([See the site I coded for my record label](https://silveroctober.neocities.org/))
- My Video Content ([Check out my YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0FbBm_5X2zGSh5jQ3n2eqQ))

The current programming languages I know are:
1. HTML
2. AFrame
3. Python3

This is list is growing as often as I can learn new stuff, please be patient as I get out there more!

The current spoken languages I know are:
1. English (Native)
2. Japanese (Developing)
3. Spanish (Basic)
